",Influenza (seasonal flu),"Influenza is a highly contagious viral respiratory infection, and is spread by respiratory droplets that are released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Infected persons can spread the flu to others up to 6 feet away. The flu has an incubation period of 24 to 48 hours after exposure. There are three main types of influenza (A, B, C). Type A is most able to change its structure from year to year, giving it the ability to produce widespread outbreaks. Because Type A so frequently changes its structure, a new type of vaccine is required each year to protect against the strains of the virus that are circulating that year. The disease is usually self-limited (resolves without treatment), but can be fatal in the very young, very old, or if there is a coexisting depression of the immune system. It sometimes can be difficult to tell the difference between a cold and the flu based on symptoms alone.

For that reason, anticoagulants (blood thinners) are given for persistent atrial flutter and before cardioversion (if a person has been in atrial flutter for more than a few days). Some patients are in atrial flutter, usually along with atrial fibrillation, their entire lives.","Palpitations, light-headedness, shortness of breath, fainting, chest pain, anxiety.",Atrial flutter (irregular heart rate),"Normally, the two small chambers of the heart (the atria) beat about 60-80 times a minute, in a regular rhythm. In atrial flutter, the two atria beat very rapidly (90-150 times a minute) and usually the large chambers of the heart (ventricles) respond irregularly causing an irregular and rapid heart rate. This disorder at times occurs along with another type of rapid and irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. The main causes of this disorder include mitral valve disease, high blood pressure, heart attacks, thyroid disease, a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolus), stimulants (cocaine, methamphetamines), drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, viral infections and stress from other illnesses.",,0

The ankle is a complex joint containing the tibia and fibula of the lower leg and the talus bone of the foot. Strong ligaments keep the ankle bones in place. Simple fractures can be treated just with a walking boot. Complex fractures tear ligaments and cause distortion of the ankle joint. These complex fractures typically require surgery. If the skin is broken (as in an open or compound fracture) surgery and antibiotics typically are required.,Bone Scan,1
949,"A history and physical exam will be performed. The fungus may be grown from any body fluid. An antigen test can also be done on the blood, urine or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). X-rays and possibly a CT scan may be performed to see the infection and damage in the chest. ","Antifungal medications are the main treatment and can be given by mouth or intravenously depending on the seriousness of the infection. The medications used include: itraconazole, ketoconazole and amphotericin. Other treatments may be needed if there is a severe lung infection or a disseminated infection such as admission to the hospital or breathing support. ","Some people have no symptoms. The acute infection resembles the flu with fever, chills, cough, and chest pain with breathing. The chronic infection causes chest pain, cough, sweating, fever, breathing problems (shortness of breath), and occasionally coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Disseminated infections cause fevers, breathing problems, headaches, confusion, skin nodules, mouth sores, neck stiffness, and joint pain.",Histoplasmosis (fungal infection),"A fungal infection caused by the Histoplasma capsulatum fungus. The fungus infects people throughout the world.  In the U.S., the fungus is most common in the southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and central states. The fungus grows as mold in the soil and enters the body through the lungs when people breath in infected particles. There are three types of infection, an acute lung infection, a chronic lung infection, and an infection that involves the entire body (disseminated). The initial infection can cause symptoms such as cough and fever but some people will not experience any symptoms (asymptomatic). The disseminated infection is more common in the very young, the very old, and in those with a weakened immune system. The disseminated infection is frequently lethal. Long term scarring in the chest can occur resulting in damage to the lungs, blood vessels, esophagus, and heart.","Lumbar puncture, blood culture, sputum culture, urine culture, antigen tests",0

Gloves should be worn. If gloves are not available, use a piece of cloth or paper to pick up the tick after it is removed. If they are available, use tweezers to grab the tick as close to its head as possible. Pull the ticks head away from the skin, trying not to crush the body. Try to remove the entire tick at once, and if possible save the tick in a jar in case the doctor wants to examine what kind of tick it is. After removal clean the area with a mild soap and water. People should seek medical attention if all the tick cannot be removed, or if they develop other symptoms such as fever, rash, weakness, vomiting, muscle aches, or joint aching.","Skin irritation, mild itching at the bite, visible tick in the skin, mild redness. If the tick is causing other diseases a patient may experience fever, rash, swollen joints, vomiting, weakness, swollen lymph nodes or headache.",Tick bite,"Ticks are related to spiders. There are over 800 different types of ticks. Tick bites are more common during April through September. Ticks attach themselves to the skin and drink blood in the skin. Most ticks can be easily removed using tweezers and do not require other treatment. Some ticks carry other serious diseases such as: Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Tick Paralysis, Tick Borne Encephalitis and other Rickettsial infections. A person's risk of getting one of these diseases is associated with where they live in the US.",,1
951,A history and physical exam will be done. The provider will do blood tests to evaluate the patient's platelet count. The diagnosis is confirmed by identifying antibodies in the blood against the Coxiella burnetii bacteria that causes the disease. An echocardiogram may be performed to look for lesions in the heart.,Acute Q fever is treated with the antibiotic doxycycline (Vibramycin) and the length of treatment is usually 2-3 weeks. At times a second course of antibiotics is needed. Chronic Q fever requires multiple antibiotics and the length of treatment is usually 18 months or longer. If the heart valves are infected surgery may need to be done to remove the infected tissue or repair damages to the heart or aorta.,"Some patients will have no symptoms.

The official definition is survival for greater than 24 hours after being rescued. It is estimated 6,000-8,000 people die from drowning every year. The most common causes of near drowning are: poor swimming abilities; impaired mental function due to drinking alcohol or head injuries; attempted suicide; falling through thin ice; and trying to save someone who is drowning. Another common cause is leaving small children unattended around bodies of water. After removal from the water, immediate CPR if the person is not breathing is essential to survival. Up to one third of near drowning patients suffer moderate to severe brain damage.",,0
955,A history and physical exam will be performed. A stool sample will be tested to look for the toxins C. difficile produces. A colonoscopy may be done to examine the inside of the colon. Rarely a CT scan will be performed to look for damage done by the infection.,The mainstay of treatment is giving the oral antibiotics metronidazole (Flagyl) or vancomycin (Vancocin).

",Broken bones (fractures),"Any break in a bone is called a fracture. The severity of the break is determined by its size and if alignment of the bones remains intact. If the alignment is not normal then the fracture is called displaced. The fractured bone fragments can be sharp and cause damage to surrounding nerves, tendons, surrounding organs and even puncture through the skin. Breaks that pierce through the skin are called open fractures. Open fractures are especially serious because they can become infected. A stress fracture is also called a hairline fracture and can sometimes be difficult to see on a plain x-ray. Sometimes a CT scan or MRI is needed to make the diagnosis. ",,0
958,"A history and physical exam will be performed. The provider may take ascites fluid from the abdomen to analyze it. This is called a paracentesis. A CT scan, ultrasound and/or MRI may be done to help determine the cause of the fluid. ","Therapy is aimed at determining and reversing the cause of the ascites. Simply removing the fluid (paracentesis) is many times only a temporary solution since the fluid reaccumulates, sometimes even within a few days.

Most are dark brown. The majority of moles are not dangerous, but some can turn into the skin cancer called malignant melanoma. The ABCDE rule can help one know the difference between a mole and melanoma. A: Asymmetry-moles are symmetric in shape, melanomas are asymmetric meaning they look different on one side compared to the other. B: Border-moles have regular borders, melanomas have irregular, rugged or notched borders. C: Color-moles have the same color throughout while melanomas tend to have varied colors within the same growth. D: Diameter-moles tend to be less than 1/4 inch (6mm) whereas melanomas often are larger. E: Evolution-moles do not change size, shape or color, whereas changing size, shape or color increases the chance that the skin lesion is melanoma. The medical term for a mole is a nevus.",,0
978,A history and physical exam will be done. A complete blood cell count (CBC) will determine the number of platelets. The blood cells will be examined under a microscope. A blood test will be performed to look for antibodies against platelets. A bone marrow biopsy may also be done.,"Many patients do not need treatment because the platelet counts remain high enough to prevent any bleeding. These patients are observed closely and may need periodic transfusions if they undergo surgery. When the platelet counts become low enough to cause bleeding, different treatments are available.  Medical treatment consists of steroids and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). Surgical treatment involves the removal of the spleen (splenectomy). This leads to a rise in the number of platelets, since the spleen is the main place in the body where platelets are destroyed.","Pinpoint red spots under the skin (petechiae).

1003,A history and physical exam will be done. A health professional can sometimes see the detachment of the retina with an ophthalmoscope (a special magnifying viewer). Many times the defect in the retina cannot be seen unless an ophthalmologist uses a special lens called a gonioscope.,"Treatment within the first 24-48 hours of the sudden symptoms is essential: the longer the retina is detached the more likely permanent loss of sight will occur. Very simple and small detachments may not require treatment. However, particularly if the retina also is torn, immediate treatment is required. The most common treatments use beams of laser light or freezing (cryopexy) to reattach the retina to its proper location in the back of the eye. Surgery for the detachment includes: pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling, or vitrectomy.","Sudden appearance of floaters (spots or strings in the field of vision), sudden flashes of light, loss of vision (described as a shadow or veil), sudden blurry vision.",Detached retina (retinal detachment),"The retina is pulled away from the back of the eye (choroid) causing the cells of the retina to lose their blood supply. The retina is the ""film"" of the eye that allows light to be detected and is necessary for proper sight. The longer the retina stays detached the more likely permanent damage and permanent loss of vision will occur. Early diagnosis and treatment can save the vision of the eye. The most common causes of this disorder include: trauma, diabetes, and inflammation of the eye and aging of the jelly-like fluid in front of the retina (the vitreous). Retinal detachment is more common in patients over 40, those with a family history of the disease, and in extreme near sightedness. ",,1

The retina is the ""film"" of the eye that detects light and is located in the back of the globe of the eye. The vitreous gel can liquefy and shrink pulling away from the retina. The vitreous gel separating from the retina is called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). PVD is more common as one ages and with extreme nearsightedness. In general PVD does not cause a decrease in vision unless blood enters the vitreous gel (posterior vitreous hemorrhage). A small percentage of patients (3%-7%) with PVD can go on to develop a retinal detachment because the vitreous pulling away from the retina creates suction that pulls the retina away from the back of the eye where it belongs. Retinal detachment is an emergency condition that can cause permanent loss of vision if it is not treated immediately. ",,0

Patients are encouraged to drink plenty of fluids. Antiviral medications can be given but should be started within 40 hours of the first symptoms. Each year the effectiveness of these drugs changes and selection is based on the type of influenza and the resistance of the virus. The two antivirals recommended by the CDC are oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). These medications can also be given to prevent the disease (called prophylaxis).

The muscle aches and fatigue tend to be more severe as well. ",Flu (influenza),"Influenza is a common, contagious viral respiratory infection. People start developing symptoms about 24 to 48 hours after the virus first enters their body. There are three main types of influenza (A, B, C). Type A is most able to change its structure from year to year, giving it the ability to produce widespread outbreaks. Because Type A so frequently changes its structure, a new type of vaccine is required each year to protect against the strains of the virus that are circulating that year. The disease is usually self-limited (resolves without treatment), but can be fatal in the very young, very old, or if there is a coexisting depression of the immune system. It sometimes can be difficult to tell the difference between a cold and the flu based on symptoms alone. In general the flu is worse than the common cold and symptoms such as fever (usually over 101F) and body aches are more severe with the flu.

The best therapy includes controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, exercising, not smoking, and keeping diabetes under control. Medications used to treat CAD are aspirin, high blood pressure pills, nitroglycerin, and statins to lower cholesterol. Treatment for a heart attack is aimed at improving the blood flow to the heart, treating life threatening arrhythmias, and maximizing the heart function. During a heart attack, clot busting medication (alteplase/t-PA) often is used to break apart the blood clot that has stopped blood flow to one part of the heart. In people with angina (and sometimes in people having heart attacks), coronary (heart) artery blockages are reduced by the following: balloon angioplasty, stent placement, surgical bypass, blood thinners and anti-platelet medications (aspirin, abciximab/ReoPro, eptifibatide/Integrilin, clopidogrel/Plavix).

A hemoglobin electrophoresis can detect the abnormal hemoglobin. A DNA analysis can identify the abnormal gene causing thalassemia. ,Minor thalassemia does not usually require treatment. The major form often requires multiple blood transfusions to treat the anemia. These transfusions can lead to iron overload requiring medications to remove the excess iron called chelators. The most severe forms may need a bone marrow transplant.,"Symptoms vary depending on if the patient has the major or minor version, and patients with minor thalassemia may have very few symptoms. Symptoms include: fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin, weakness, yellow coloration of skin (jaundice), facial deformities and slow growth.","Thalassemia (Mediterranean anemia, inherited blood disorder)","An inherited blood disorder that causes low numbers of red blood cells (anemia). Hemoglobin is a substance in the red blood cells that carries oxygen and consists of two proteins, alpha globulin and beta globulin, plus iron. Alpha thalassemia occurs when not enough alpha globulin is made, and beta thalassemia when not enough beta globulin is made. These defects cause the premature destruction of the red blood cells leading to anemia. Thalassemia is inherited and alpha thalassemia is seen most often in people of southeast Asia, the Middle East, China, and African descent. While beta thalassemia is more frequent in people from the Mediterranean. There are two further classifications: major and minor. Major is more serious and occurs when a patient inherits a thalassemia gene from each parent. Minor is less severe, many times not needing treatment, and occurs when only one gene is inherited. Complications of thalassemia major include: bone deformities, enlarged spleen, stunted growth, iron overload, and heart failure.","DNA analysis, Hemoglobin electrophoresis",0

The most common causes of vagus nerve damage are surgery and diseases such as diabetes, scleroderma, medications (narcotics, antidepressants), anorexia, Parkinson's disease and hypothyroidism. Gastroparesis can lead to malnutrition, bacterial overgrowth in the stomach, and blood sugar fluctuations. ",,0
1047,A history and physical will be done. The diagnosis is generally made from the characteristic skin rash. Blood tests and blood cultures may be performed. At times a skin biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis. ,Intravenous antibiotics to kill the staphylococcus bacteria and intravenous fluids are needed. Pain medication may be given as well. Moist compresses can be applied to the skin for comfort. The skin generally heals 10 days after treatment.,"Fever, irritability, and decreased activity. The skin blisters, becomes red, and large areas peel away. The rash is painful and gentle pressure causes the skin to slide away and become detached (Nikolsky's sign). ",Scalded skin syndrome (blistering skin infection),A skin infection caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus. The bacteria produces a toxin that damages the skin and causes it to shed. The red and peeling skin resembles a burn giving this disorder its name. The disease most commonly affects children less than 5 years old. Fluid loss from the blisters can cause dehydration and problems with the patient's blood chemistry. Left untreated the bacteria can enter the blood stream and lead to a life threatening infection (sepsis). With the appropriate treatment full recovery is usually achieved. ,,0
1049,A history and physical exam will be done. A colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy will be done to make the diagnosis. Special CT scans can diagnose polyps as well.,Polyps generally are removed and examined under a microscope to detect early cancer and to prevent the polyps from becoming cancer later. Most polyps can be removed through the scope the doctor uses to identify the polyps (colonoscopy). Rarely a polyp is too large to be removed during colonoscopy and surgery is required. If a patient has familial adenomatous polyposis complete colon removal is recommended. ,"Rectal bleeding, bloody stools, maroon-colored stools. Rarely large polyps can cause a bowel obstruction leading to abdominal pain, abdominal distension and constipation.",Colon polyps (large intestine tumors),"Small growths in the large intestine (colon). The growths stick out from the inner lining of the colon, and push into the empty space inside the colon. Colon polyps usually are harmless although some will turn into cancers. Whether cancerous or not, polyps can bleed. Polyps are more common in patients with the following characteristics: eat low fiber diets, family history of polyps, overweight, cigarette smoker, over 50 years old or family history of colon cancer. Some families have genetic conditions that cause multiple family members to have multiple polyps. One such condition is called familial adenomatous polyposis. The incidence of these polyps becoming cancerous is quite high and many doctors recommend removal of the colon to prevent cancer.",sigmoidoscopy,1

A bronchoscopy may be done to get a sample of the inside of the lungs.,Therapy depends on the cause of the disorder and the severity of the disease. The cause of the allergic reaction must be removed by either stopping the medication or treating the parasite infection. Once the offending agent is taken away the lungs usually clear up on their own. The following medications may be used: steroids and bronchodilator breathing treatments (albuterol). ,"Fatigue, fever, dry cough, chest pain, breathing problems, wheezing, rash.","Loffler's syndrome (pulmonary eosinophilia, lung inflammation)",Inflammation of the lung caused by eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are increased during an allergic reaction. The eosinophils fill the lung air spaces causing symptoms similar to pneumonia.

Other treatment options include hyperbaric oxygen and exchange transfusions.,"Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis), breathing problems, fatigue. The inherited type can cause stunted growth, mental retardation, seizures, and failure to thrive.",Methemoglobinemia (blood disorder),"High levels of a form of hemoglobin called methemoglobin are found in the blood. This may be caused either by an inherited condition or by exposure to a medication or drug. Hemoglobin carries the oxygen in the blood and is found within the red blood cells. Because methemoglobin is not able to carry oxygen normally, it causes a bluish discoloration to the skin. The most common drugs to cause the disorder are: benzocaine, lidocaine, dapsone, chloroquine, nitrates, and nitrites. Nitrates are sometimes inhaled and used as a drug of abuse called ""poppers"". The disease can be very serious leading to very low blood pressure, seizures and death.",,0
1052,A history and physical exam will be done. The eyes will be examined and the blockage of the retinal artery can sometimes be seen. A CT scan and/or MRI of the brain will be done. Imaging studies of the neck such as an ultrasound may also be performed to look for blockages of the carotid artery. Blood tests are also routinely examined. ,"Immediate therapy is aimed at removing the blockage of the retinal artery Since time is very important immediate medical assistance is needed. Treatment options include surgery, interventional vascular treatment with clot busting medications, and medications. The medications most commonly prescribed include: aspirin, clopidogrel, and aspirin and dipyridamole. Treatment after an episode of amaurosis fugax, to prevent it from recurring, involves various lifestyle changes, medicines and techniques for reducing the plaque buildup in the carotid arteries.",Sudden loss of vision in one eye. The decreased vision can lasts seconds to hours. The loss of vision can be complete or is sometimes described as a veil being pulled over the eye. The loss of vision is usually painless.,Amaurosis fugax (momentary vision loss in one eye),"A sudden loss of vision in one eye caused by a blockage of blood flow to the retinal artery. The retinal artery supplies blood to the retina. The retina captures the light in the back of the eye and transmits these images to the brain. This condition is sometimes followed by a stroke and is considered very serious. The blockage of the retinal artery is usually due to a piece of plaque that builds up in the carotid arteries in the neck. The carotid arteries supply blood to the brain. The plaque buildup is caused by atherosclerosis, and consists of fat deposits and calcium.",,0
1053,A history and physical will be done. Examination of the wound will reveal the injury to the tendon. The healthcare provider can also detect the injury by demonstrating weakness or inability to move the extremity.,Most cut tendons require surgical repair. The doctor uses stitches to sew the ends of the tendon back together. Generally the affected area is splinted for 4-6 weeks after the repair.,"Inability to move the affected extremity, weakness of the extremity.",Tendon laceration (tendon cut),A partial or complete laceration of the tendon. Tendons connect muscles to bones and enable movement of the extremity. The most common cause of a tendon laceration is a cut that extends through the skin injuring the underlying tendon.,,0

Foul smelling yellow fluid can leak from the swollen areas. ,Hidradenitis suppurativa (chronic collections of pus),"Inflammation, swelling and infection of the armpit, groin, buttocks or under the breast. Tender bumps develop and can turn into a collection of pus (abscess). The area is painful, warm to touch and can drain foul smelling yellow fluid. The inflammation begins after the sweat glands in the affected area become clogged allowing bacteria to infect the skin and sweat glands. Hydradenitis suppurativa usually begins after puberty and can be recurrent. If the condition is not treated chronic scarring and a surrounding skin infection can occur called cellulitis. Sometimes cellulitis can be life threatening. ",,0
1058,"A history and physical exam will be done. Blood levels will be done to measure total cholesterol, LDL and HDL. A triglyceride level is usually checked as well.
","Treatment depends on how high the LDL level is and if other risk factors for developing blockage of the arteries (atherosclerosis) are present. Eating healthy foods, exercising more, and losing weight can improve mild elevations of cholesterol. Other treatments include medications such as statins (atorvastatin/Lipitor, fluvastatin/Lescol, lovastatin/Altocor or Mevacor, pravastatin/Pravachol, rosuvastatin/Crestor, simvastatin/Zocor), bile acid binding drugs (cholestyramine/Prevalite or Questran, colesevelam/Welchol, colestipol/Colestid), cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe/Zetia) and combination drugs (ezetimibe-simvastatin/Vytorin). ",There are usually no symptoms related to having elevated cholesterol.,High cholesterol (hypercholesteremia),"Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood increases the risk of having narrowed arteries. The blockage is caused by a buildup of plaque and fat deposits (atherosclerosis). The diseases caused by this narrowing are dependent on the arteries being blocked but include: heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral vascular disease. People with elevated cholesterol also are likely to suffer from high blood pressure and diabetes. There are two types of cholesterol that make up the total level of cholesterol, LDL and HDL. LDL is considered bad cholesterol and HDL is good cholesterol. To know a patient&#39;s true risk of disease the provider must send a blood test that measures both LDL and HDL. In general the LDL should be less than 130 mg/dL and anything greater than 160 mg/dL is considered too high. An HDL level lower than 40 mg/dL increases the risk of atherosclerosis. A person&#39;s cholesterol level is determined in part by inheritance, and in part by the foods he or she eats. Improving one&#39;s diet and/or medications can generally reduce the levels.

Some injuries can be watched closely in the hospital to ensure no further bleeding occurs. Sometimes an interventional radiologist can block the artery feeding the spleen (embolization) preventing further bleeding. If the splenic bleeding will not stop or if the patient has already lost too much blood surgery is necessary to remove the spleen. Some patients may require a blood transfusion as well. All patients who have their spleen removed are more prone to certain bacterial infections, and generally should be immunized against the pneumococcus, hemophilus and meningococcus bacteria.","Abdominal pain, pain in the upper abdomen. pain in the left upper abdomen, abdominal pain that increases with a deep breath, light headedness, fainting, sweating, nausea, vomiting, fast heart rate, weak pulse, abdominal distension.",Spleen injury (splenic rupture),"The spleen is located in the left upper abdomen under the ribs. This organ removes old red blood cells from the blood and holds red blood cells for emergency use by the body. The spleen is also important in fighting infection: it removes bacteria covered by antibodies against the bacteria that are made by the immune system. The spleen is the most commonly injured organ after blunt trauma such as a motor vehicle accident, falling, or after being hit in the abdomen. It can also be damaged from a gunshot wound or stabbing. The spleen filters about 10% of the blood supply every minute and injuries can cause a great deal of bleeding into the abdomen. Failure to get rapid treatment can result in death. People without a spleen are more susceptible to infections later in life. People with mononucleosis should avoid physical activity for several months since their spleen can temporarily enlarge with the infection: even minor trauma can cause a spleen injury. ",,0

A patient cannot live without a liver so only the damaged parts of the liver that cannot be saved will be removed. The liver can regenerate itself if the bleeding can be stopped. Some liver injuries are caused by a biopsy of the liver, but this is rare.",,0
1061,A history and physical exam will be done. Blood tests such as a complete blood cell count will be performed to detect any damage to the bone marrow that produces white blood cells. A Geiger counter may be used to detect radiation particles coming from the patient. ,"Therapy is aimed at decontamination, treating internal contamination, and trying to prevent damage to the white blood cells. If the radiation exposure is high patients will be decontaminated in a secure area to prevent exposing other patients. Healthcare providers will wear protective clothing as well. All contaminated clothing should be removed and the patient should be cleaned with soap and water. Decontamination should be done as soon as possible to prevent on-going radiation damage. The medications used depend on the type of radiation exposure and include: potassium iodide, Prussian blue, and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). Patients with possible damaged bone marrow may be given filgrastim (Neupogen) or pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) to stimulate white blood cell production. Damage to the internal organs causing dehydration, low blood pressure, bleeding or confusion will be treated as needed. ","Symptoms depend on the dose of radiation and how long a patient is exposed.

Feeling lightheaded during or after urination.,Micturition syncope (fainting with urination),"Fainting while urinating or just after urinating. This problem usually occurs in older men and during the night when they wake up to urinate. This occurs because urinating stimulates the vagus nerve, which then causes a drop in blood pressure and a slow heart rateresulting in fainting. Why urinating stimulates the nerve in some people but not others is unknown. Straining to urinate may increase the frequency of this disorder. Certain medications, alcohol and being dehydrated can increase the frequency of these events. It is recommended patients with this disorder see their doctor to make sure something more serious is not causing the fainting.

There are 7 neck or cervical vertebrae, 12 in the middle of the back called thoracic vertebrae, and 5 in the lower back referred to as lumbar vertebrae. These fractures typically occur when a vertical force is applied to the head, feet or buttocks which causes a compression of the spine. This disorder is more common in the elderly population who have less calcium in their bones (osteopenia), and in these patients the fracture can occur from something as minor as sitting down too hard. Compression fractures are graded by how much loss of height has occurred to the vertebra. A loss of half is called a 50% compression fracture. If the fracture is severe the bone fragments can enter the spinal canal and damage the spinal cord resulting in paralysis. ",,0

If a skin infection occurs the patient will experience skin redness, skin swelling, increased warmth and pain.",Pemphigus (rare skin disorder),"A disease in which a person's immune system attacks (autoimmune disease) the skin and mucous membranes (mouth and genitals). The outer part of the skin separates from the inner part of the skin in various places, causing blisters to form. These blisters can cause open sores and lead to skin infections. Rarely these infections can become serious. The disorder can occur at any age but is more common in the middle age group. There are three types of pemphigus. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common type and affects the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus foliaceus only involves the skin. Paraneoplastic pemphigus involves the skin, and is associated with cancer.",,0
1114,A history and physical exam will be done. A urine test (urinalysis/UA) and a measurement of the amount of urine will be done. Imaging tests of the brain such as an MRI may be performed.,Treatment depends on the type of diabetes insipidus. Central diabetes insipidus is treated with desmopressin which replaces the missing ADH. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is managed by reducing salt intake and drinking increased water. Occasionally the water pill hydrochlorothiazide will be prescribed. ,"Excessive thirst, increased urination (polyuria), dry mouth, dry skin, fatigue, muscle pain.",Diabetes insipidus (excessive water loss from the kidneys),A rare disorder that causes too much urine to be produced because the kidneys are not able to absorb the correct amount of water as the blood is being filtered. The hypothalamus in the brain produces a hormone called ADH (antidiuretic hormone) which is stored in the pituitary gland. ADH normally causes the kidneys to absorb water from the urine before it leaves the kidneys and enters the bladder. Diabetes insipidus is caused by a failure of the hypothalamus to produce ADH (central diabetes insipidus) or by a failure of the kidneys to react normally to ADH (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). This disorder can cause dehydration or abnormalities of the blood chemistry (electrolytes). Diabetes insipidus is not related to the more common diabetes that causes elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels (diabetes mellitus). ,,0
1115,A history and physical exam will be performed. The doctor can usually find the hernia during a physical exam. At times a CT scan or MRI will be performed to establish the diagnosis and the extent of the hernia.,"Some hernias do not need any treatment. Hernias that are very painful, or that have abdominal contents trapped in the defect, require surgery. Sometimes, the intestines become blocked secondary to being stuck and pinched in the hernia. When this happens, surgery needs to be performed as soon as possible to prevent death of the intestine. If the intestines loose blood supply (strangulation) and die they can rupture resulting in an infection of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis) which can result in death.","A soft bulge in the abdomen that becomes larger with coughing, crying or straining, and becomes smaller with relaxation. The bulging area can be tender. If the intestines become blocked then vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal distension occur.",Ventral hernia (bulging of the abdominal wall),A weakening in the abdominal wall that allows abdominal contents to protrude through the defect. If the intestines poke through the defect they can become blocked. At times the intestine can lose blood supply and die leading to a life threatening infection. Ventral hernias can occur after surgery and are more likely to develop if the patient is obese. Ventral hernias involving the belly button are called umbilical hernias.,,0

Pregnant women may only experience flu like symptoms and need to seek medical attention immediately since the infection can cause a miscarriage. ",Listeria (serious bacterial illness),"Listeria is a bacteria that causes the food borne illness listeriosis. Listeriosis causes fever, chills, headache, and vomiting, and can be fatal. The bacteria listeria is unique because it can live and grow in the cold temperatures of the refrigerator. Only heat can kill this germ. The bacteria cannot be tasted or smelled and patients can become sick 2-30 days after eating infected foods. Pregnant women, patients with a weak immune system, and the elderly are the most susceptible and they should be extra careful with certain foods. The best way to prevent an infection is to use precooked foods and ready to eat foods as soon as possible, avoid raw milk, only eat cheeses made from pasteurized milk, wash fresh fruits and vegetables, scrub the outside of melons before cutting, and avoid eating meat and seafood that are not well cooked. Remember the best way to be safe about a food is to make sure it fully cooked at high temperatures since this is the only method to kill the bacteria.

","Pain in the front and back of the shin, pain that is worse in the beginning of the exercise session, mild swelling of the front of the lower leg, pain with bending the toes or foot downward. If the disorder continues the pain may be present even when the patient is not exercising. ",Shin splints (tibial stress syndrome),"Refers to pain in the shin secondary to overuse of the leg. The pain can arise from inflammation of the bone (tibia), the muscle or connective tissue. The most common causes are ill-fitting shoes, over training, and running on hard surfaces. Patients who have fallen arches (flat feet) are also more likely to suffer from this problem. Prevention is the best medicine with shin splints. To reduce the risk of this disorder: 1) Do not increase running distances by more than 10% per week; 2) Avoid running on hard surfaces; 3) Wear shoes that fit well and are made for running long distances; and 4) Stretch the muscles of the lower leg and ankle.",,0

Many other symptoms can occur depending on the location of the cancer and whether the growth is damaging other organs. For example, sarcomas involving the lung can cause shortness of breath and/or chest pain; involvement of the abdomen can cause a blockage of the intestine resulting in vomiting and stomach pain. ",Sarcoma (soft tissue cancer),"A malignant cancer of the soft tissue including the muscles, nerves, fat, blood vessels, tendons and covering of the joints (synovium). These cancers are rare but very dangerous and if not detected and treated early can result in death. One particular type is called Kaposi sarcoma and is seen in patients with weakened immune systems such as AIDS. While this disorder can occur at any age it is generally seen in older patients. The risk of this cancer increases with exposure to the chemicals vinyl chloride and dioxin. Radiation exposure for the treatment of other cancers also increases one risk of the disease.

Patients with severe reactions should have a medical alert bracelet and carry a self-injectable epinephrine pen. Patients should try to avoid any triggers that cause their symptoms. Some patients have problems with general anesthesia and they should notify their provider of their condition before any medical procedure. ,"Skin symptoms include a red itchy rash, hives, red to brown blotches that resembles freckles and skin swelling after itching. Abdominal pain and diarrhea can occur. Some patients can have what looks like a life-threatening allergic reaction consisting of fainting, sweating, confusion, low blood pressure and breathing problems.","Mastocytosis (urticaria pigmentosa, skin disease)","Mastocytosis is caused by an abnormal growth of mast cells. Mast cells are anti-inflammatory cells made in the bone marrow. They release the chemical histamine. Histamine causes swelling, itching and redness and is one of the substances responsible for an allergic reaction. This disorder can occur at any age but is most often seen in children. Many times the disease will resolve on its own in puberty. The most common site for the increased number of mast cells is in the skin although other areas such as the intestines can be affected. The symptoms are caused by a trigger such as exposure to cold or heat, certain medications, insect stings, or emotional stress.

Later symptoms may include decreased urination, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. ",Diabetic nephropathy (diabetes and kidney disease),"Diabetic nephropathy means kidney damage caused by diabetes.  High blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) for long periods of time and uncontrolled high blood pressure make it progress more rapidly. The elevated blood sugar and blood pressure cause injury to small blood vessels in the kidneys. As the kidneys become damaged they are unable to remove waste products from the blood. Over time the kidneys can completely fail requiring the patient to need dialysis or a kidney transplant. The likelihood of having this disorder increases with age and with the length of time someone has diabetes. Patients of African, Hispanic, and American Indian descent are more likely to develop diabetic nephropathy. This condition may occur in both Type I and Type II diabetics. Patients with this disorder do not begin having symptoms until a majority of the kidney function is lost.

1586,A history and physical exam will be performed. An X-ray will be taken to show if there is decay or a problem with the tooth's nerve. ,Dentinal sensitivity can be treated with a fluoride varnish to protect teeth. The dentist may use a laser or other treatment to reduce sensitivity. Pulpal sensitivity will be treated with a root canal if the tooth's nerve is dead or dying. The outlook for symptom relief depends on the cause of the sensitivity.,Sensitivity to temperature or pressure. Sensitivity to cold food and drink is more common. Sensitivity to heat can be a more serious symptom.,Sensitive teeth,"People with sensitive teeth feel discomfort when the teeth are touched or when they drink or eat certain things. Dentinal sensitivity occurs when the outer protective layer of a tooth wears away. Causes include hard brushing, poor oral hygiene, untreated cavities and exposed tooth roots. Pulpal sensitivity affects the center layer of the tooth. Causes include decay or infection, a recent filling, clenching or grinding of teeth, or a cracked or broken tooth. Gums tend to recede as people get older. This may expose sensitive root surfaces.","Biting test, hot and cold tests",0
1588,A history and physical exam will be performed to see if the affected gland is swollen. If the gland discharges pus it may be tested for bacteria. Images of the salivary glands and ducts may be taken.  ,"Treatment will involve antibiotics. It is very important to make sure the body has enough fluids. Intravenous (IV) fluids may be needed. The doctor also may recommend sugar-free chewing gum or candies to stimulate saliva production. If the infection does not improve, surgery may be needed. Sialadenitis usually goes away within one week if treated appropriately.","The first symptom is often a tender, painful lump in the cheek (in front of the ear) or under the chin. Pus drainage into mouth, fever, chills, and malaise (a general sick feeling) may also develop.",Sialadenitis (salivary gland infection),"When saliva flow is reduced or stopped, bacteria can grow in a salivary gland. This can cause an infection called sialadenitis. It occurs most often in people over the age of 50 who have a debilitating illness and dry mouth (xerostomia). However, it can happen in any age group, including infants. A stone (sialolith) or kink also can reduce flow through one of the tubes that carry saliva.","Bacterial culture, MRI, CT scan",0

People who smoke, dont remove their dentures daily, or have type 2 diabetes or weakened immune systems are at an increased risk of developing this condition.",,0
1592,A history and physical exam will be performed. No special tests are needed. A dentist can diagnose tooth discoloration by looking at the teeth. ,"Treatment depends on the cause of tooth discoloration. Some stains caused by food or drink (extrinsic) can be removed by professional cleanings and proper home care. Others can be removed by bleaching, either in the dentist's office or at home. A dentist can lighten some intrinsic stains by applying bleach inside the tooth. Other intrinsic stains are permanent. Discolored or badly damaged areas can be covered by a color-matched bonding material or thin ceramic shells called veneers. Brushing teeth after every meal, rinsing after drinking wine or coffee, and having regular cleanings can help prevent tooth discoloration.","Stains on the enamel of the teeth. Stains can include white streaks, a yellow tint, brown spots and pits.",Tooth discoloration,"Tooth discoloration is caused by stains on the outer layer of the tooth (extrinsic), changes inside the tooth (intrinsic), or age-related changes (combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors). Coffee, wine, other drinks or foods, and smoking cause extrinsic stains. Intrinsic stains are caused by trauma, too much fluoride during early childhood, or use of tetracycline antibiotics during pregnancy or early childhood. Age-related tooth yellowing has two causes. The outer enamel layer gets thinner, allowing the yellower dentin layer to show through. Extrinsic stains also build up with age.",,0
1594,A history and physical exam will be performed. Tori can be diagnosed by looking in the mouth. An X-ray may be taken. A biopsy may be done if the torus is getting larger or is in an unusual place.  ,"Most tori do not require treatment. If they are causing problems, then surgery may be needed. This procedure often can be done in an oral surgeons office. Very large ones are sometimes removed in an operating room. The outlook for tori is excellent.",Often few symptoms. Some foods may irritate tori in the roof of the mouth. Large tori may interfere with speech or dentures.,Tori,"A torus (plural ""tori"") is a harmless growth of bone in the mouth.

The doctor will examine your mouth to assess saliva flow and look for cracks, sores, and signs of cavities and gum disease. ","Treatment of xerostomia includes relieving symptoms and increasing the flow of saliva. Chewing sugar-free gum or candies can increase saliva production. Using a saliva substitute, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, avoiding smoking, and drinking water throughout the day also can help relieve symptoms. With proper treatment, xerostomia can improve. Dry mouth increases the risk of tooth decay. Good dental hygiene and fluoride treatments from a dentist will reduce the risk.","Xerostomia is a symptom. It often occurs along with other symptoms. Common ones include frequent thirst, difficulty swallowing, dry, cracked lips, inflamed tongue, dry nasal passages, bad breath, and increased dental problems.",Xerostomia (dry mouth),"Xerostomia is commonly known as dry mouth.

1602,A history and physical exam will be performed to look for spaces between teeth.,"Treatment depends on the underlying reason and the size of the gap. Often, a diastema will not need treatment unless the person does not like how it looks. A gap between teeth can be closed in several ways. These may include orthodontic treatment (braces), porcelain veneers, dental implants, a dental bridge, or a partial denture.",Symptoms depend on the reason for the gap. Some people have no symptoms. Other people may have loose teeth or pain during biting or chewing.,Diastema (gap between teeth),"Diastema is a gap or space between two teeth. It appears most often between the two upper front teeth. However, it can occur between any two teeth. Common causes include having teeth that vary in size, a size mismatch between the teeth and the jawbones, thumb sucking, gum disease, or a smaller and thicker than normal amount of tissue between the two front teeth. In children, a gap between teeth usually is part of normal development. Most of the time, the space closes by itself when permanent teeth come in.",,0

Using a fluoride gel or rinse at home may help reduce sensitivity. The dentist also may apply a fluoride varnish. The outlook is excellent if the problem is caught early, and the cause is eliminated. To prevent abrasion and erosion, avoid acidic foods or drinks, brush gently with a soft toothbrush, and use dental floss and toothpicks properly.","Sensitivity to sweet, hot or cold foods and drinks. Toothbrush abrasion causes V-shaped notches near the gum line. Abfraction lesions, caused by forces on the chewing surface, can make the notching worse. Tooth erosion leaves a smooth, scooped out area on the tooth surface. ",Tooth abrasion and erosion,"Abrasion and erosion are two types of damage to the tooth's outer covering, the enamel. Sometimes they also affect deeper parts of the tooth. Tooth abrasion is caused by rubbing or scraping against the teeth. Brushing too hard is a common cause. Using toothpicks can cause abrasion. So can removing and replacing partial dentures or retainers. Chemicals such as acids cause tooth erosion. Usually the acids are in foods or drinks, such as citrus fruits, soda (regular or diet) and some fruit juices. Acid reflux and frequent vomiting, as in bulimia, also can cause tooth erosion.",,0
